**Benefits**
Custom budgets that meet your needs:
- Track your cost, usage, or coverage and utilization for your Reserved Instances and Savings Plans, across multiple dimensions, such as service, or Cost Categories. 
- Aggregate your costs with an unblended or amortized view and include or exclude certain charges, such as tax and refunds. - Configure your Budget Actions with IAM policies, Service Control Policies (SCPs), and targeted running instances.  

**Stay informed with alerts and reports**
- Set up event-driven alert notifications for when actual or forecasted cost or usage exceeds your budget limit, or when your RI and Savings Plans' coverage or utilization drops below your threshold. 
- You can also choose to be informed on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis with pre-scheduled Budgets Reports.


**Granular budget time periods**
- Create annual, quarterly, monthly, or even daily budgets depending on your business needs. 
- This allows you to take timely actions to prevent cost or usage overage, or inefficient utilization or resource coverage of your Reserved Instances and Savings Plans.
