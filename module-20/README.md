AWS CloudTrail is an auditing service that monitors API activity in your account. Whenever you perform any operation in the account this results in an API action and this information is recorded to create an audit trail.

Amazon CloudWatch is a performance monitoring service. AWS services send metrics about their utilization to CloudWatch which collects the metrics. Additionally, CloudWatch collects metrics about account activity such as billing information which can also be viewed.

Which AWS services can a company use to gather information about activity in their AWS account.

## <a id="section-4"></a> **4 - Amazon CloudWatch**

![Amazon CloudWatch](../images/Architecture-Service-Icons_01312022/Arch_Management-Governance/48/Arch_Amazon-CloudWatch_48.png "Amazon CloudWatch")


Amazon CloudWatch is a performance monitoring service. AWS services send metrics about their utilization to CloudWatch which collects the metrics. You can then view the results in CloudWatch and configure alarms.

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS.

CloudWatch is for performance monitoring (CloudTrail is for auditing).

Used to collect and track metrics, collect, and monitor log files, and set alarms.

Automatically react to changes in your AWS resources.

Monitor resources such as:

- EC2 instances.
- DynamoDB tables.
- RDS DB instances.
- Custom metrics generated by applications and services.
- Any log files generated by your applications.


Gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization.

CloudWatch monitoring includes application performance.

Monitor operational health.

CloudWatch is accessed via API, command-line interface, AWS SDKs, and the AWS Management Console.

CloudWatch integrates with IAM.

Amazon CloudWatch Logs lets you monitor and troubleshoot your systems and applications using your existing system, application, and custom log files.

CloudWatch Logs can be used for real time application and system monitoring as well as long term log retention.

CloudWatch Logs keeps logs indefinitely by default.

CloudTrail logs can be sent to CloudWatch Logs for real-time monitoring.

CloudWatch Logs metric filters can evaluate CloudTrail logs for specific terms, phrases, or values.

CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:

- Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution custom metrics.
- Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1 minute) are available for 15 days.
- Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5 minute) are available for 63 days.
- Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).

Dashboards allow you to create, customize, interact with, and save graphs of AWS resources and custom metrics.

Alarms can be used to monitor any Amazon CloudWatch metric in your account.

Events are a stream of system events describing changes in your AWS resources.

Logs help you to aggregate, monitor and store logs.

Basic monitoring = 5 mins (free for EC2 Instances, EBS volumes, ELBs and RDS DBs).

Detailed monitoring = 1 min (chargeable).

Metrics are provided automatically for several AWS products and services.

There is no standard metric for memory usage on EC2 instances.

A custom metric is any metric you provide to Amazon CloudWatch (e.g. time to load a web page or application performance).

Options for storing logs:

1. CloudWatch Logs.
2. Centralized logging system (e.g. Splunk).
3. Custom script and store on S3.

Do not store logs on non-persistent disks:

Best practice is to store logs in CloudWatch Logs or S3.

CloudWatch Logs subscription can be used across multiple AWS accounts (using cross account access).

Amazon CloudWatch uses Amazon SNS to send email.

**Definitions**

Allows you to centralize operational data from multiple AWS services and automate tasks across your AWS resources.

### **Features**

- Create logical groups of resources such as applications, different layers of an application stack, or production versus development environments.

- You can select a resource group and view its recent API activity, resource configuration changes, related notifications, operational alerts, software inventory, and patch compliance status.

- Collects information about your instances and the software installed on them.
Allows you to safely automate common and repetitive IT operations and management tasks across AWS resources.

- Provides a browser-based interactive shell and CLI for managing Windows and Linux EC2 instances, without the need to open inbound ports, manage SSH keys, or use bastion hosts. Administrators can grant and revoke access to instances through a central location by using IAM policies.

- Helps ensure that your software is up-to-date and meets your compliance policies.
- Lets you schedule windows of time to run administrative and maintenance tasks across your instances.

**SSM Agent** is the tool that processes Systems Manager requests and configures your machine as specified in the request. SSM Agent must be installed on each instance you want to use with Systems Manager. On newer AMIs and instance types, SSM Agent is installed by default. On older versions, you must install it manually.

### **Security**
- Systems Managers is linked directly to IAM for access controls.

### **Pricing**

- For your own packages, you pay only for what you use. Upon transferring a package into Distributor, you will be charged based on the size and duration of storage for that package, the number of Get and Describe API calls made, and the amount of out-of-Region and on-premises data transfer out of Distributor for those packages.
- You are charged based on the following:
    - Number and type of Automation steps.
    - Number of OpsItems, change requests, and API requests.
    - OpsItems created and runbook steps executed.
    - Number of configuration requests and received.
    - Number of advanced parameters stored and instances activated.

## <a id="section-18"></a> **18 - AWS Trusted Advisor**

![AWS Trusted Advisor](../images/Architecture-Service-Icons_01312022/Arch_Management-Governance/48/Arch_AWS-Trusted-Advisor_48.png "AWS Trusted Advisor")


**Definitions**

- Trusted Advisor analyzes your AWS environment and provides best practice recommendations in five categories:
    - Cost Optimization
    - Performance
    - Security
    - Fault Tolerance
    - Service Limits

- Access to the full set of Trusted Advisor checks is available to Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, and Enterprise Support plans.

### **Concepts**
- The AWS Support API gives you access to some of the AWS Support Center’s features and provides two different groups of operations:
- Support case management – operations to manage your AWS support cases throughout their entire life cycle, from creation to resolution.
- Trusted Advisor – operations to access AWS Trusted Advisor checks.
- The endpoint to access the AWS Support API: https://support.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
- If you have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you can access all checks via the AWS Support API and the AWS CLI.
- For the Basic and Developer Support plan, use the Trusted Advisor console to access core security checks and checks for service limits.
- You can use the Trusted Advisor console or the AWS Support API to perform operations on the following Trusted Advisor checks:
- Cost Optimization – identify unused resources and opportunities to lower your bill.
- Performance – improve the speed and responsiveness of your applications.
- Security – recommends settings that can improve the security of your AWS solution.
- Fault Tolerance – highlight redundancy shortfalls, current service limits, and overused resources.
- Service Limits – shows the current usage limit for AWS services and resources.
- The summary checks are displayed on the Trusted Advisor dashboard.
- Action recommended (red) – recommends an action for the check.
- Investigation recommended (yellow) – detects a potential problem with the check.
- No problems detected (green) – no issue identified for the check.
- Excluded items (gray) – resources that you want a check to disregard.


### **Security**
- You can use IAM policies to grant users or roles in your account access to AWS Trusted Advisor’s organizational view.
- With AWS Security Hub, you can view the Trusted Advisor check’s status, the list of affected resources, and then follow recommendations to address security issues.

### **Monitoring**
- You can use Amazon EventBridge to detect when the status of your Trusted Advisor checks changes. Then, based on the rules you define, it performs one or more target actions whenever the status changes to a value specified in a rule.
- To create a rule for Trusted Advisor checks, you must have an AWS Support plan.
- You can also create alarms in Amazon CloudWatch to detect changes in the status of Trusted Advisor metrics.
- Supports logging a subset of the Trusted Advisor console actions and API operations as events in AWS CloudTrail.

**Pricing**
- By default, the Basic support plan is already included in your account.
- You only pay for the Developer, Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, and Enterprise Support plans
