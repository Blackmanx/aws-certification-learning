## <a id="section-1" ></a> **1 - Amazon Inspector**
![Amazon Inspector](../images/Architecture09172021/Arch_Security-Identity-Compliance/48/Arch_Amazon-Inspector_48.png)

The AWS Cloud allows for a shared responsibility model.

AWS manages cloud security; you are responsible for security in the cloud.

You retain control of the security you choose to implement to protect your own content, platform, applications, systems and networks just as you would in an on-premises data center.

**Amazon Security Benefits**
- Keep your data safe – AWS infrastructure implements strong protections to help.
- Protect your privacy – All data is stored in highly secure AWS data centers.
- Meet compliance requirements – AWS manages dozens of compliance programs across its infrastructure. This means that your compliance segments have already been completed.
- Save money – reduce costs by using AWS data centers. Maintain the highest standard of security without having to manage your own facilities.
- Scale quickly – Security scales using the AWS Cloud. No matter the size of your business, the AWS infrastructure is designed to keep your data safe.

**Compliance**
AWS Cloud Compliance lets you understand the robust controls in place at AWS to keep your data safe and secure in the cloud.

As systems are built on top of the AWS Cloud infrastructure, compliance responsibilities will be shared.

Compliance programs include:
- Certifications / attestations.
- Laws, regulations and privacy.
- Alignments/frames.

![Amazon Artifact](../images/Architecture09172021/Arch_Security-Identity-Compliance/48/Arch_AWS-Shield_48.png)

**WAF:**
- AWS WAF is a web application firewall.
- Protects against common exploits that can compromise application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
- WAF allows you to create rules to filter web traffic based on conditions that include IP addresses, HTTP headers and body or custom URIs.
- WAF makes it easy to create rules that block common web exploits such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
- Rules are known as Web ACLs.

**AWS Shield**
- AWS Shield is a managed distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection service.
- Protects the web application running on AWS with always-on detection and automatic in-line mitigations.

## <a id="section-5"></a> **5 - AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)**

![Amazon Artifact](../images/Architecture09172021/Arch_Security-Identity-Compliance/48/Arch_AWS-Key-Management-Service_48.png)

AWS Key Management Service gives you centralized control over the encryption keys used to protect your data.

You can create, import, toggle, disable, delete, set usage policies, and audit the usage of encryption keys used to encrypt your data.

The AWS Key Management Service is integrated with most other AWS services, making it easy to encrypt the data stored in those services with encryption keys that you control.

AWS KMS is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, which gives you the ability to audit who used which keys, on which resources, and when.

AWS KMS allows developers to easily encrypt data, either through one-click encryption in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS SDK to easily add encryption to application code.

## <a id="section-9" ></a> **9 - Penetration Testing**

**Penetration Testing** is the practice of testing the security of the application itself for vulnerabilities, simulating an attack.

AWS allows **Penetration Testing**. There is a limited set of resources on which penetration testing can be performed.

**You do not need permission to perform penetration tests on the following services:**
- Amazon EC2 instances, NAT Gateways, and Elastic Load Balancers.
- Amazon RDS.
- Amazon CloudFront.
- Amazon Aurora.
- Amazon API Gateways.
- AWS Lambda and Lambda Edge functions.
- Amazon LightSail resources.
- Amazon Elastic Beanstalk environments.

You can read the full vulnerability and penetration testing support policy [here](https://aws.amazon.com/en/security/penetration-testing/) .

If an account is or could be compromised, AWS recommends that the following steps be taken:
1. Change your AWS root account password.
2. Change all IAM user's passwords.
3. Delete or rotate all programmatic (API) access keys.
4. Delete any resources in your account that you did not create.
5. Respond to any notifications you received from AWS through the AWS Support Center and/or contact AWS Support to open a support case.

Amazon Cognito lets you add user enrollment, login, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily.

Amazon Cognito scales to millions of users and supports signing in with social identity providers such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon, and corporate identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

The two main components of AWS Cognito are User Pools and Identity Pools:
- **User pools** are user directories that provide enrollment and sign-in options for your app users.

![Amazon Artifact](../images/Architecture09172021/Arch_Security-Identity-Compliance/48/Arch_AWS-Directory-Service_48.png)


AWS provides several types of directories.

The following three types currently appear on the exam and will be covered on this page:
- Active Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory.
- Simple AD.
- AD connector.

As an alternative to the AWS Directory service, you can create your own Microsoft AD DCs in the AWS cloud (on EC2).

The table below summarizes the directory services covered on this page, as well as a few others, and provides some typical use cases:


|Directory Service Option |Description |Use Case|
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
|AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory |Full Microsoft AD managed by AWS running on Windows Server 2012 R2 |Enterprises that want hosted Microsoft AD or you need LDAP for Linux applications|
|AD Connector |Allows on-premises users to sign in to AWS services with their existing AD credentials. It also allows EC2 instances to join the AD domain |Single sign-on for local employees and to add EC2 instances to the domain|
|Simple AD |Low-scale, low-cost AD implementation based on Samba |Simple user directory or you need LDAP compatibility|

## <a id="section-99" ></a> **25 -  How do I report abuse of AWS resources?**


### **I suspect that AWS resources are used for abusive or illegal purposes. How do I let AWS know?** [here](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/report-aws-abuse/)

**Resolution:**
The AWS Trust & Safety team can assist you when AWS resources are used to engage in the following types of abusive behavior:
- **Spam:** You are receiving unwanted emails from an AWS-owned IP address, or AWS resources are used to spam websites or forums.
- **Port scanning:** Your logs show that one or more AWS-owned IP addresses are sending packets to multiple ports on your server. You also believe this is an attempt to discover unsecured ports.
- **Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks:** Your logs show that one or more AWS-owned IP addresses are used to flood ports on your resources with packets. You also believe that this is an attempt to overwhelm or crash your server or the software running on your server.
- **Intrusion attempts:** Your logs show that one or more AWS-owned IP addresses are used to attempt to log in to your resources.
- **Hosting prohibited content:** You have evidence that AWS resources are used to host or distribute prohibited content, such as illegal content or copyrighted content without the consent of the copyright holder.
- **Distributing malware:** You have evidence that AWS resources are used to distribute software that was knowingly created to compromise or cause harm to computers or machines that it's installed on.

If you suspect that AWS resources are used for abusive purposes, contact the AWS Trust & Safety team using the Report Amazon AWS abuse form, or by contacting abuse@amazonaws.com. Provide all the necessary information, including logs in plaintext, email headers, and so on, when you submit your request.

The AWS Trust & Safety team will use the information that you provide in this form to investigate and attempt to resolve the incident you have reported. We might share your information, if it is necessary for the investigation of your report.

Note: AWS Support can't assist with reports of abuse or questions about notifications from the AWS Trust & Safety team. If you have questions for the AWS Trust & Safety team, reply directly to their email.

If you suspect that AWS resources are used for abusive purposes, contact the AWS Trust & Safety team using the Report Amazon AWS abuse form, or by contacting abuse@amazonaws.com. Provide all the necessary information, including logs in plaintext, email headers, and so on, when you submit your request.
